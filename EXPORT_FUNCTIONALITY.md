# Export Functionality - Hierarchical Role Management

## Overview

The SmartLearn University Management System provides comprehensive export functionality that respects the hierarchical role structure. Each role has specific export capabilities based on their administrative scope and responsibilities.

## Role Hierarchy

The system supports 5 user roles with increasing administrative scope:

1. **STUDENT** - Basic user, no export capabilities
2. **LECTURER** - Course-specific exports
3. **DEPARTMENT_ADMIN** - Department-level exports
4. **SCHOOL_ADMIN** - School-level exports
5. **SENATE_ADMIN** - System-wide exports
